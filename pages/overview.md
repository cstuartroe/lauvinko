Lauvìnko was a Kasanic language of the Malaccan Strait area of modern
Malaysia and Indonesia, attested from the 9^{th} to the 19^{th} century CE. Its
location at a major crux of Indian Ocean trade brought it into close contact
with major fronts of culture, commerce, and the influence of multiple regional
and global empires, making it a front-row spectator on the history of Classical
and Early Modern Southeast Asia. Despite picking up huge amounts of cultural
and lexical influence from Malay, Pali, and Sanskrit, and less but significant
from languages as various as Arabic, Tamil, Hokkien Chinese, Swahili,
Portuguese, and Dutch, the language and identity remained vigorously
distinct throughout its history, beginning with the inception of a unified
Lauvìnko identity in the reign of the legendary 9th century chief Socyàng.

Given the broad range of time across which Lauvìnko is attested, it went
through multiple stages that could properly be termed distinct languages. The
oldest attested form, Old Lauvìnko, refers to the literary language established
within the court of Socyàng, which more or less remained the language of
formal writing for much of the rest of Lauvìnko history. Before the time of
Socyàng, Lauvìnko was occasionally and haphazardly written using variants
of regional writing systems, but Old Lauvìnko was the first form to be
standardized and written with the Palavaytòlis, essentially a variant of the
regional Kawi abugida. Old Lauvìnko is broadly similar to Proto-Kasanic, the
reconstructible ancestor of the later Kasanic languages; both existed within
roughly the same time frame, but Old Lauvìnko refers to a specific literary
variant, while Proto-Kasanic, a more theoretical term, refers more broadly to
a conservative combination of the variants extant at the time, including some
features reflected in daughter languages which are absent in Old Lauvìnko.

For the first six centuries of Lauvìnko history, the spoken language is lost - all
that survives is the conservative written language which essentially preserved
Old Lauvìnko, though a general timeline of phonological change can be
discovered via diachronic analysis and loanwords. The first widespread
renewal of written Lauvìnko came with Portuguese rule in the 16th century,
when colloquial Lauvìnko began to be written with the Latin alphabet in
informal contexts. Writing with the Latin alphabet was unstandardized, 
directly representing the writer’s spoken dialect and closely associated with
the vernacular. The simpler spelling and colloquial grammar allowed wider
literacy than the increasingly baroque Old Lauvìnko. This influence began
extending to formal written language as well – while the Palavaytolis
remained the standard for official writing, standards of spelling and especially
grammar became more closely aligned with the contemporary language,
forging an updated written standard. The language of this time period is
collectively called Early Modern Lauvìnko, which may refer to the new written
standard or, in dialectology, to the 16th century language which is the basis for
all later dialects.

The variant of Lauvìnko described herein is Modern Lauvìnko, the last few
centuries of the language’s existence before its death in the late 19th century.
Phonemic structure, spelling, and (unless specifically noted otherwise)
grammar are based on the Early Modern Lauvìnko written standard. Specific
details of pronunciation and most notes on colloquial language are descriptive
of the spoken language of Malacca City as of my study in 1711-1717.

Lauvìnko is a typically verb-final language that exhibits a mix of head and
dependent marking, with head-final tendencies across almost all criteria. Its
nominal morphology is modest, with synthesis mostly limited to case/gender
suffixes and a few semantic affixes. Verbs exhibit somewhat more synthesis
through polypersonal agreement, the use of agglutinating affixes marking
aspect and voice, and limited noun incorporation. Less concatenative fusion
is limited to case marking on pronouns and tense/aspect marking on some
verbs.

Lauvìnko shows great flexibility in the part of speech of roots. It has an
unusual morphosyntactic alignment, which is best summarized as split-S, but
in which volition and patientivity are marked as well. It shows some ergative
tendencies syntactically, and order of core arguments can be influenced by
animacy. Lauvìnko is a strongly topicalizing language, featuring a variety of
applicatives and other valency-changing operations to keep discourse topics
at the front of a sentence.

Phonologically, Lauvìnko has a relatively small phonemic inventory, quite
average phonotactic complexity, and a two-tone pitch accent system. A
number of sandhi rules govern the phonological behavior of morpheme
compounds.

Lauvìnko has a moderately complex kinship system, and three sets of second-
person pronouns depending on social context. Its native number system is
dominantly base 20 with significant vestiges of base 12.
