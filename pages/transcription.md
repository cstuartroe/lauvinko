The transcription scheme I use in this document hews more closely to
the phonetic realization in standard accent than to the underlying
phonemic value, though I don't explicitly represent all consonant
assimilations (cf. [](consonants)).

Vowels are always written phonemically: /a e i o/ are written ⟨a e i o⟩.
/eɐ̯ iɐ̯ oɐ̯/ are ⟨ea ia oa⟩.

In the syllable onset, consonants are largely written as their IPA symbols:

|                 | Labial | Alveolar | Dorsal | Glottal |
|:----------------|:------:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|
| **Nasal**       | m ⟨m⟩  |  n ⟨n⟩   | ŋ ⟨ng⟩ |         |	
| **Stop**        | p ⟨p⟩  |  t ⟨t⟩   | k ⟨k⟩  |         |	
| **Affricate**   |        | t͡s ⟨c⟩  |        |	
| **Fricative**   |        |  s ⟨s⟩   |        |  h ⟨h⟩  |
| **Approximant** | ʋ ⟨v⟩  |  l ⟨l⟩   | j ⟨y⟩  |         |

Of these, only /s j/ are usually written the same way in coda position.
/ʋ/ is written ⟨u⟩ in the coda (where it is pronounced [w]). /t͡s/ is
written ⟨s⟩ in the coda when it is pronounced [s] (that is, everywhere
except before /j/).

When coda stops occur before another obstruent, where they fully assimilate
and geminate the following consonant, they are written as a doubling
of the following letter: ⟨pp tt kk cc ss⟩. All stops (as well as
the affricate /t͡s/) coalesce with a following /j/ to [t͡ːɕ]; [t͡ːɕ] is
always written ⟨cy⟩. In all other circumstances, coda stops are written ⟨h⟩.

Coda nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following
consonant, where they are written ⟨m⟩ before a labial consonant and
⟨n⟩ otherwise. Note that this leads to the geminates [mː nː ɲː ŋː]
being written ⟨mm nn ny nng⟩.

Coda /l/ is written ⟨l⟩ in the sequences /ll lj/ [lː~ɭː ʎː]: ⟨ll ly⟩.
In all other circumstances, it is written ⟨r⟩, including when it
coalesces with a following coronal consonant.

The accented syllable of a word is indicated with a diacritic: high
flat pitch accent is indicated by an acute accent mark ⟨á é í ó⟩,
and falling pitch accent is indicated by a grave accent mark ⟨à è ì ò⟩.
The diacritic is always placed above the first letter of a diphthong.
