Actual pronunciation of Lauv√¨nko varied quite widely among dialects, but all 
variants are essentially predictable in view of sets of synchronic processes 
applied to the diaphonemic structure. This section is mostly concerned with 
this diaphonology, and phonetic notes describe the fairly conservative dialect 
of 18th century urban speakers of [Malacca](https://goo.gl/maps/6xAjC2y7mktKKtWS8).
