This section describes all of the Lauvìnko morphology which
derives from Proto-Kasanic. Indeed, since no morphology was lost during the
transition from Proto-Kasanic to Lauvìnko, it also serves as a description
of Proto-Kasanic morphology, merely seen through the phonological lens of
Lauvìnko. Proto-Kasanic was an exclusively prefixing language, and all
of its morphology is essentially verbal: concerning tense, aspect, and mood,
as well as trigger (≈subject) agreement and subordination marking. In both
Proto-Kasanic and Lauvìnko, some of this morphology appears in nouns as well,
albeit in ways that might mostly be characterized as derivational.
