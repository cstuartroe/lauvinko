Welcome to the Lauv√¨nko online reference grammar!

There are two ways to navigate through the grammar. You can navigate
through the sections linearly with the arrows to the left and right of
the page title, or navigate hierarchically via the "Go up" link above
and the page buttons below. If you're interested in reading the grammar
in order like a book, you may prefer linear navigation. If you're interested
in a specific section or sections, you may find the hierarchical navigation
to be quicker.
