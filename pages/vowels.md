Lauvìnko possesses four vowels /a e i o/, the pronunciation of which varies
widely by phonological context. In the most standard, conservative
realization, in all closed syllables they are [ɐ ɛ ɪ ʊ], in unaccented open syllables
they are [ɐ ɪ ɪ ʊ], and in accented open syllables they become [ɑː eː iː oː].
There are also three centering diphthongs /ɛɐ̯ ɪɐ̯ ʊɐ̯/ which are considered
closed rimes phonologically. They cannot be followed by a coda consonant.
The sequences /aj oj aʋ eʋ iʋ/, pronounced [ɐj ʊj ɐw ɛw ɪw], occur, but are
considered vowel-consonant sequences rather than diphthongs. In
unaccented syllables /aj aʋ/ might become [ɐj ɐw] or [ɪ ʊ].
