Lauvinko morphological alternation shows a high degree of complexity
and apparent irregularity, arising both from regular phonological
and inflectional processes dating to Proto-Kasanic (which was substantially
more regular in its morphology), and the idiosyncracies
introduced by historical sound change since then. Discussing all of the
patterns that surface in morphological alternation would be too complex,
but this section contains a discussion of some of the most salient and
well-defined processes.
