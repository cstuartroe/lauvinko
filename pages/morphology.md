Lauvìnko is a highly synthetic language. With some important
exceptions, it generally does
not exhibit wholesale fusion of morphological categories in the
manner of many Indo-European languages, with one affix usually
conveying a single piece of grammatical information; however,
sandhi between
adjacent morphemes can be quite complex, so it can be difficult
to parse apart the constituent bits of a word.

Its morphology is also characterized by a lack of firm distinction
between nominal and verbal stems, in a manner somewhat like Classical
Nahuatl. That is, all stems are largely alike in what morphological
inflections they may take. 

```
man.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$-$par$-$def$ long.$gn$.$na$
The man is tall.
```

```
long.$gn$.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$-$par$-$def$ man.$na$
The tall one is a man.
```

Further, many types of affixes can be used
both by words behaving syntactically like nouns, and by those acting
as verbs. In theory, a maximally morphologically complex Lauvìnko noun may have
up to ten morphemes, in this order:

- An [incorporated stem](/incorporation)
- An [applicative prefix](/applicatives) (used derivationally)
- A [tertiary aspect prefix](/tertiary)
- A [dependent marker](/trigger_agreement)
- A main lexical stem (which shows internal case/aspect inflection, albeit formulaically)
- A [biological sex suffix](/sex_suffix)
- A [class word](/class)
- A [collective suffix](/collectives)
- A [case suffix](/cases)
- A [definite suffix](/partitive)

Of course, it is nearly impossible to find a natural example of such
a large noun. An example of a nearly-maximal noun (containing a morpheme
at each position except a collective suffix or a definite suffix) is given:

```
yellow.$gn$.$na$=$vol$=$pro$-$dep$-marry.$inc$.$na$=$femn$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$-$all$

to his jolly bride-to-be
```

It's harder to define a maximal number of morphemes for verbs, as there
is a category of prefixes I call "modals" which variously mark deontic and
epistemic modality as well as some other subordination marking and adverbial
functions, of which several may be applied at once to a verb. Taking modals
as a single "slot" in the verbal template, a Lauvìnko verb has eight
morphological slots:

- An [incorporated stem](/incorporation)
- An [applicative prefix](/applicatives)
- [Modal prefixes](/modals)
- A [tertiary aspect prefix](/tertiary)
- A [trigger agreement marker, or dependent marker](/trigger_agreement)
- A [voice prefix](/trigger_agreement)
- A main lexical stem (with internal case/aspect inflection)
- A [class word](/class) for object/focus agreement

A key concept in Lauvìnko morphology is the distinction between **conjunct**
and **disjunct** affixes (cf. [](glossing)). In essence, conjunct affixes are
those which date to Proto-Kasanic, while disjunct prefixes originate more
recently from independent words which lose their own pitch accent
due to morphological closeness to another word. Conjunct affixes are limited
to prefixes with mainly verbal usage - modal, tertiary aspect, trigger
agreement, and voice prefixes. Disjunct affixes include incorporated stems,
applicative prefixes, enclitic class words, and collective noun suffixes.

This distinction may seem arbitrary at first, but in fact it
is quite clear-cut, for two reasons:

- Conjunct prefixes are always bound morphemes and may never appear
as independent words. In contrast,
although disjunct affixes are phonologically connected, they may
usually appear as phonologically unbounded words in some contexts
(note the distribution of cart.$na$ and $lea$.$sg$.$na$ in the examples 
below). For this reason I often use the terms "clitic", "enclitic", 
or "proclitic" interchangeably with "disjunct affix."

```
$1excl$.$sg$.$au$-$vol$ cart.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$dat$ $dep$-search.$pf$.$na$

(that) I found the cart
```

```
$1excl$.$sg$.$au$-$vol$ $lea$.$sg$.$na$-$dat$ $dep$-search.$pf$.$na$

(that) I found it
```

```
cart.$na$ $dat$=$t1s$-$tvol$-search.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$

I found the cart
```

- The morphophonological rules governing conjunct prefixes
are categorically different and more
complex than those which take place with disjunct affixes. For
instance, [](mutations) only take place after conjunct prefixes.
There are many other surprising irregularities exhibited by
conjunct prefixes, introduced by historical sound change.

```
$st$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

they spoke
```

```
$dat$=$st$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

they spoke about it
```

```
if-$st$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

if they spoke
```

Case suffixes are an edge case. They originate from the same lexical source
as the applicative prefixes - namely, the core set of Proto-Kasanic
postpositions - and certainly did not behave as dependent morphemes
in Proto-Kasanic. There is even an argument to be made that they behave
in the same manner syntactically as some words which continue to
function as phonologically independent, such as the coordinating
conjunction `lv;fr and` "and." These facts make them seem like disjunct
affixes. However, they exhibit an idiosyncratic sandhi with the preceding
stem that differs from that typical of both conjunct and disjunct prefixes,
even showing some fully irregular combinations with class words. Also,
as case suffixes they may never appear as phonologically unbounded
in modern Lauvìnko. I treat them thus as conjunct affixes in my
glossing and morphological model, because it simplifies the handling
of their more irregular morphophonological behavior.

Conversely, the biological sex suffixes seemingly date to Proto-Kasanic,
although they saw scant usage then. They may even have arisen via reanalysis
of the last syllable of unitary lexical items in early forms of Lauvìnko.
In any case, they have been much more widely applied in modern forms of
the language, even appearing in personal names. Uniquely, their phonology
happens to render them immune to any of the sandhi characteristic
of conjunct affixes, so there is no need to treat them as such in my
morphological model. I have elected to treat them as disjunct
affixes because it allows them to be used more flexibly.
