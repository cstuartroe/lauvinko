At first the Lauvìnko appear to have lived as an autonomous set of
communities independent of those around them. They comprised something
on the order of twenty kampung villages, each with perhaps a resident bigman 
but little in the way of established internal political organization. Only
one population center, the village Mánasi on Rupat, seems to have had about
two thousand inhabitants, and at the time of the historical debut there
appears to have been a transition in progress toward a primitive chiefdom,
uniting the other Lauvìnko kampungs politically via the diplomatic and
military pressures of `lv ft ^sutra.$na$=cart.$na$` (`pk ft sutra=cart`, 
from Sanskrit सूत्रयान *sūtrayāna* 
“vehicle of scripture”), the chief of Manási, who had seemingly procured 
both weapons and political ideas via the influences of Srivijaya to the south.
At this time Srivijaya did not exert much in the way of active territorial
control in the Malay Peninsula, though the trade of the Tamils, the Chinese,
and the natives that passed through the Straits were controlled and taxed by
its rulers. This created perfect conditions for the conception of a politically
and culturally advanced Lauvìnko, which could pilfer ideas and resources
from the world around it with minimal interference. The dominance of
Socyàng seems to have provided a medium for the diffusion of Indian writing
and religion through Lauvìnko society.

It was Socyàng’s inner circle of bureaucrats who first used the Palavaytòlis
abugida, a derivative of the Pallava script and a visibly close relative of the
widely-used Kawi script that abounded in maritime Southeast Asia, to write
trade records and temple dedications. Socyàng formally adopted Mahayana
Buddhism following the example of the self-proclaimed rajas around him, and
over the next two hundred years Mahayana practices would settle in to
overlay the animist ancestor worship native to the Lauvìnko. While any
degree of political unity achieved dissolved following the death of Socyàng in
883, his actions laid the foundation of a concept of collective Lauvìnko society
and set several cultural tones that would be perpetuated.

This period saw the first movements to urbanization among some young
Lauvìnko men, who traveled to cities (chiefly Kedah, and later Singapore and
Pagarruyung) and became involved in trade or clergy as a way to acquire
wealth. Malacca had not yet been founded as city. This was most often
temporary, beginning around the age of sixteen in order to earn money for a
bride token, in order to make themselves more attractive marriage prospects.
They would typically return to their home villages to wed, and stay there for
the rest of their adult lives. During this period, the Botharu society originated
as a diaspora community of Lauvìnko people who relocated more
permanently, mostly wealthy families for professional mercantile reasons.
Eventually this community concentrated in Chaiya, further north on the
Malay Peninsula in modern Thailand, and lost connection with the rest of
Lauvìnko society.
