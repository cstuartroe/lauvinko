Lauv√¨nko syllable structure is broadly limited to (C)V(C). Diphthongs cannot
be followed by a coda consonant. Vowel sequences are never allowed, and
syllables may only lack an onset word-initially. 

In keeping with this, words are always syllabified such that single
intervocalic consonants are the onset of the subsequent syllable.
When words ending in a coda consonant receive a suffix beginning with a
vowel, including an epenthetic vowel, the coda shifts to the onset of the next
syllable, and allophony rules are applied according to the new syllablic
structure.

```lv;frbna
throat.$na$=$rck$.$na$, throat.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$abl$

interior, from the interior
