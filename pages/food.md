Lauvìnko cuisine was very rich and diverse, drawing from the numerous
cooking traditions present in the region, including Malay, Chinese, and Tamil.
The core ingredients were common to most Southeast Asian culinary
traditions, limited by the indigenous plants and animals, but later on some
imported ingredients became popular. Early on in their history, staple foods
included breadfruit, chicken, eggs, coconut, and all types of seafood. Chinese
and Indian immigrants brought other foods like rice, soy, dairy, lentils, and
wheat bread, which came to hold a greater role in the cuisine. Beef was
completely absent from the diet, in accordance with Hindu belief, and pork
also tended to be avoided, perhaps due to its scarcity in a Muslim-dominated
region. Favorite vegetables included cabbage, bok choy, lotus root, cucumber,
tamarind, water spinach, scallions, sweet potatoes, and shiitake, and common
fruits included banana, mango, lime, jackfruit, longan, papaya, mangosteen,
watermelon, starfruit, pineapple, and dragon fruit.

Rice formed the basis of most meals. Rice was very commonly served on a
banana leaf, often accompanied by a gravy or chutney, a protein, and a
“pickle” (mixture of fresh or fermented fruits and vegetables). Other dishes
might use bread, noodles, fried breadfruit, or rice porridge as a starchy base.
Common protein sources were boiled eggs, tempeh, fried tofu, fried chicken,
fish and many other sea animals such as squid, sea cucumber, or shrimp.
Gravies were often based on coconut milk, fermented beans, or yogurt, and
typically heavily spiced. Gravies and meat preparations alike made use of
complex curry mixtures that might incorporate chili paste, garlic, ginger,
turmeric, pandan, tamarind, vinegar, lemongrass, and a base of fermented soy 
or shrimp paste. Most Lauvìnko dishes were spicy enough to make grown nonLauvìnko men cry.

For small daily meals, families would typically steam rice and prepare some
curried protein and a pickle to be eaten throughout the day. Formal meals
were not typically served as a sequence of courses, but rather as a concurrent
display of dishes. At festivals, there could be a mind-boggling diversity of
items served, with diners choosing portions of whatever they liked.

Alcohol consumption was not very widespread in Lauvìnko society due to the
influence of the predominantly Muslim Malay society. There is some evidence
that use of cannabis, opium, and nutmeg snuff as psychoactive drugs existed
in Lauvìnko society. In later history, drinking black or green tea became
popular among the affluent.sc
