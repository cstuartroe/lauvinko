Lauvìnko has a pitch accent system by which content words have one
accented syllable, though grammatical particles and pronouns may carry no
accent whatsoever. The accent-bearing syllable will have one of two tones,
either high level or falling, with the prosody of the rest of the word
determined by the location and tone of the accent. Syllables following a high
level accent have a mid-level pitch slowly falling toward the end of the word,
and those following a falling accent have low pitch. All syllables preceding an
accent have a low pitch. In addition to a tonal difference, accented syllables
are distinguished by the lengthening of open rimes.

Native words typically bear accent on the first syllable of the root, or 
on the second syllable in roots with historical vowel breaking 
(cf. [](diachronic_development)). In compound
words or incorporations, which have multiple roots in the same phonological
word, non-final roots lose accent. Loanwords generally carry an accent
according to the prosody of the source language. Enclitic class words and
particles have no accent of their own and undergo other sandhi with the
preceding word.
