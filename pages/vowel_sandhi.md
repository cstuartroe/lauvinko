Vowel sequences are not allowed. A number of internal sandhi rules govern
vowels coming into contact. Unaccented /a/ is dropped before another vowel.
Unaccented word final /e/ is also dropped before an enclitic if preceded by /j/
or if the abutting vowel is /e/ or /i/.

`lv ft agitate.$pf$.$na$` "boil" (pf.) + `lv ft $bra$.$sg$.$na$` (branch class suffix) >
`lv ft agitate.$pf$.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$` "dumpling"

`lv ft build.$pf$.$na$` "build" (pf.) + `lv ft $lea$.$sg$.$na$` (leaf class word) >
`lv ft build.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$` "building"

In general, if two alike vowels come into contact, they contract.

`lv ft speak.$imnp$.$na$` "speak" (im. np.) + `lv ft $sea$.$na$` (sea class word) > 
`lv ft speak.$imnp$.$na$=$sea$.$na$` "language"

`lv ft mango.$na$` "mango" + `lv ft $bra$.$sg$.$na$` (sea class word) > 
`lv ft mango.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$` "mango"

Otherwise, a semivowel is inserted following an unaccented vowel - /j/
following /e i/, and /ʋ/ following /o/.

`lv ft $loc$=cross.$np$.$na$` "cross at" (np.) + `lv ft $lea$.$sg$.$na$`
(leaf class word) > `lv ft $loc$=cross.$np$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$`

Certain conjunct prefixes have special rules regarding vowel contact.
Generally they merely entail that the affix’s vowel disappears.
Since root-final accented vowels are uncommon, accented vowels rarely have
another vowel affixed directly after, but if they do they never disappear.
Where possible, an unaccented vowel following an accented vowel will be
merged if the vowels are alike and reduced to a semivowel if not.

`lv ft $all$=go.$pf$.$na$` "go to" (pf.) + `lv ft $bra$.$sg$.$na$` (branch
class word) > `lv ft $all$=go.$pf$.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$` "He went to it."

If the second vowel has a following coda consonant, though, reduction will be
blocked and a semivowel must be inserted instead, following /e i o/. Following
/a/, /e i o/ break into /je ji vo/.

[example needed]

When words ending in a coda consonant receive a suffix beginning with a
vowel, including an epenthetic vowel, the coda shifts to the onset of the next
syllable, and pronunciation rules are applied according to the new syllablic
structure.
