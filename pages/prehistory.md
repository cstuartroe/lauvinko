The ancestors of Lauvìnko speakers were presumably indigenous to the Malay
Peninsula since before the arrival of the Proto-Malay themselves in the third
to second millennium BCE, putting them among the so-called Orang Asli, the
Malay aboriginal population, though they differed in lifestyle from the inland
indigenous groups. They show some genetic similarities to the Iron Age
Deutero-Malays, taller and with higher frequency of the epicanthic fold
compared to other Orang Asli, suggesting intermarriage between the groups
in the pre-kampung times.

Throughout the historical record they appear generally culturally more
integrated with the Malays than other indigenous groups, following their
agricultural and religious trends from early on and eventually becoming 
prominent traders. This may have simultaneously assured their survival free
from active marginalization by Malay governance as well as their eventual
total assimilation and surrender of unique cultural and linguistic identity.
However, there is a millennium of rich existence between their appearance to
the historical record at the height of Srivijaya influence in the 800s CE, and
the death of the last Lauvìnko speaker in 1836.

The Lauvìnko people emerge onto the historical record as a mixed-sustenance
people of modest political organization, residing primarily along the coastline
and slightly inland in the modern Malaysian states of Malacca and Negeri
Sembilan, as well as on Sumatra on and around the island of Rupat. Among
domesticated animals, they possessed dogs, chickens, pigs, and banteng (socalled Bali cattle.) They also appear to have performed limited cultivation of
rice, yams, bananas, and breadfruit. This semi-agrarian lifestyle allowed them
to live in small kampungs of a few hundred individuals. However, there
appears to have been a slight cultural preference for foraging and saltwater
fishing - in particular, it was common for small bands of men to embark on
multi-day fishing voyages. Women dedicated time to gathering from the
myriad of indigenous fruits and edible plants. It seems that they extensively
traded livestock and crops from the surrounding Malay communities for
consumption but that active cultivation was initially the exception rather
than the rule. As the historical record advanced it seems that settled
agriculture became more common.
