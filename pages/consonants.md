Lauvìnko has a quite small consonant inventory 
of only 12 phonemes.

|                 |Labial| Alveolar | Dorsal | Glottal |
|:----------------|:----:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|
| **Nasal**       |  m   |    n     |   ŋ    |         |	
| **Stop**^1      |  p   |    t     |   k    |         |	
| **Affricate**   |      |   t͡s    |        |	
| **Fricative**   |      |    s     |        |   h^2   |
| **Approximant** |  ʋ   |    l     |j      |         |


^1 Stops are pronounced unaspirated.\
^2 /h/ only occurs word-initially, and is subject to deletion if a
morpheme beginning in /h/ is phonologically bound to a preceding morpheme

However, it exhibits a moderate degree of allophony arising from consonant
sequences, particularly in the coronals.
In the standard accent, the full set of consonant phones includes at
least the following (some sounds only appear geminate, and are marked
with ː)

|     |Labial|Alveolar|Retroflex|Palatal|Velar|Glottal|
|:----|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|:-----:|
|**Nasal**   |  m   |n       |   ɳː    |  ɲː   |ŋ    |       |	
|**Stop**    |  p   |  t     |   ʈː    |       |k    |   ʔ    |	
|**Affricate**|      |t͡s     |  ʈ͡ːʂ   |  t͡ːɕ  |     |       |	
|**Fricative**|      |s       |   ʂː    |   ɕː   |     |h      |
|**Approximant**|  ʋ   |       |         |   j   |     |       |	
|**Lateral** |      |  l     |         |   ʎː   |     |	      |
|**Tap**     |      |        |   ɽ    |       |     |       |	

All consonants except /h/ may occur at the end of a syllable, but
most consonants are pronounced differently in that position.
Allophonic variation in coda position can render a word ambiguous
as to underlying phonemes; in such cases, I fall back on 
morphological alternations or etymology to determine broad
phonological transcription of a word.

Coda /m n ŋ/ assimilate completely to a following consonant’s place of
articulation, and are pronounced [ŋ] word-finally, or as nasalization
on the preceding vowel.

```lv;frbna
$2hon$.$au$-$age$, $2hon$.$au$-$loc$

you, your
```

Coda stops /p t k/ assume a
variety of realizations. They assimilate completely to a following obstruent /p
t t͡s k s/, resulting in a geminate consonant [pː tː t͡ːs kː sː]. Before sonorants
/m n ŋ l ʋ/, stops generally become [h~ɦ], which may assimilate to the
preceding vowel somewhat: [ç] after /e i/, and [hʷ] after /o/; they may
even devoice or spirantize the following sonorant to [m̥ː n̥ː ŋ̥ː ɬː fː],
or simply surface as breathy voice on the preceding vowel. Stops usually
surface as a glottal stop [ʔ] word-finally. In contrast,
coda /t͡s/ becomes [s], except before [j]. All of /p t t͡s k/ mutually
assimilate with a following /j/ to become [t͡ːɕ].

```lv;frbna
fish.$na$; fish.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$; fish.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$; fish.$na$=$bra$.$du$.$na$

to be a fish; the fish (live); a fish (cooked); two fish (cooked)
```

Coda /ʋ/ becomes [w]. 

[ɽ] is an allophone of /l/ that appears syllable-finally before non-coronal 
consonants or word boundaries.

```lv;frbna
throat.$na$, throat.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$abl$

interior, from the interior
```

The other retroflex sounds emerge from 
mutual assimilation of /l/ with a following coronal and only 
appear geminate: /ln lt lt͡s ls ll/ become [ɳː ʈː ʈ͡ːʂ ʂː lː~ɭː].
Retroflex consonants thus have apparent minimal pairs with 
alveolar/dental consonants in the middle of words:

```lv;frbna
$all$=follow.$imnp$.$au$=$hea$.$sg$.$au$-$age$, $all$=follow.$imnp$.$na$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$-$pat$

Fugitive (agentive case), fugitive (patientive case)
```

All consonants except /ʋ j/ mutually assimilate with a following /j/
to become a palatal or alveolo-palatal sound. Any stop/affricate + /j/
becomes [t͡ːɕ]. Likewise, any nasal + /j/ becomes [ɲː]. /sj lj/ become
[ɕː ʎː].
