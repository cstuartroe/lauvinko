Third person pronouns are identical to classifier suffixes except that they bear
accent. The rock class does not take a classifier in the singular, with case
endings appended directly to the stem, and frequently does not mark for
plural. The rock class pronoun is the demonstrative `lv;fr this.$na$`. 
In the case of 
definite head class nouns, the ancestral pronoun took over as a classifier
rather than the other way around.

Pronouns and class suffixes distinguish at most three numbers - singular, dual,
and plural - but many do not distinguish dual from plural. All pronouns are
shown below, with augment forms on left and non-augment on right. Where
no dual is given, it is identical to plural. The familiar 2^{nd} person simply uses
the same plural form as the formal, and the honorific 2^{nd} person as well as the
sea class pronoun do not inflect for number.

Most pronouns and classifiers decline regularly for case. The most notable
exceptions are the genitives of some formally animate arguments. Forms marked
with @ are irregular:

There are a handful of other irregular pronouns: branch class has irregular
instrumentals singular `lv;fr $bra$.$sg$.$na$-$ins$` and
plural `lv;fr $bra$.$pl$.$na$-$ins$`, and leaf class singular ablative is 
`lv;fr $lea$.$sg$.$na$-$abl$`.
The partitive case mandates the use of a certain grammatical number -
singular for rock class nouns, dual for branch class nouns, and plural for all
else.

Nouns are anaphorically referred to by a pronoun according to their class. The
inclusive and exclusive first person pronoun sets differentiate whether the
listener is included, thus there is no inclusive singular, and the word 
`lv;fr $1incl$.$du$.$na$-$pat$`
specifically means "you and I."
