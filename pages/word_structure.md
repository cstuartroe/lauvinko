Lauv√¨nko syllable structure is broadly limited to (C)V(C). Diphthongs cannot
be followed by a coda consonant. Vowel sequences are never allowed, and
syllables may only lack an onset word-initially. The phoneme /h/ may also
only occur word-initially (see phonetic notes), though [h] may be a syllablefinal allophone of oral stops. Phonemically, all consonants except /h/ may
occur in coda position, though stops and nasals lose distinctive place of
articulation there, with underlying phonemic structure being knowable only
by grammatical alternations or etymology
