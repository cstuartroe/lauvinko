In this document, I try to follow consistent glossing conventions where
possible. Glosses are indented to visually set them apart from the descriptive
text, and consist of five lines – original text in Palavaytòlis, transcription,
morphological breakdown, morpheme-by-morpheme gloss, and finally a
translation. The four representations of each word are left-aligned together.

```
cart.$na$-$all$ mango.$na$ $1st$.$sg$-add.$fqpt$.$na$=$bra$.$pl$.$na$-$pat$

I loaded the mangoes into the cart.
```

In the morphological breakdown and gloss, enclitic class words and discourse
particles are joined with an equal sign (=) and affixes are joined with an en
dash (-). All grammatical features are represented in small caps. Fusional
morphemes with multiple semantic and grammatical features are glossed
with these features separated by a period (.). The most common cases of fusion
appear in class words, which represent noun class and number fusionally with
mostly unpredictable forms, in verbal roots, which mark primary tense and
aspect via vowel ablaut, and in the marking of augment on all roots and class
words via synchronically unpredictable phonological changes toward the
beginning of the root.

In the morphological breakdown I transcribe words according to what I
analyze as their underlying phonological value, including writing root-final
stops and nasals with distinct place of articulation although these would be
debuccalized syllable-finally, and writing root-initial consonant clusters
which only appear after a conjunct prefix.


```
$loc$=$3anm$.$sg$-stand.$na$=$sea$.$na$

He’s standing there.
```

```
$loc$=$1st$.$sg$-stand.$na$=$sea$.$na$

I’m standing there.
```

For the two pairs of cases with syncretic suffixes which are distinguished only
via augment (namely, dative vs. allative and locative vs. ablative), I gloss the
suffix according to the actual case. For instance, I will gloss the following two
words as having different suffixes even though those suffixes are not
phonologically distinguishable:

```
cart.$na$-$all$

to the cart
```

```
cart.$au$-$dat$

for the cart
```

Because so many grammatical features appear in most glosses, I have limited
my abbreviations for each to two letters. While this may be difficult to read
initially, it ultimately saves a lot of space. Here is the full set of abbreviations
that will appear in this document:
