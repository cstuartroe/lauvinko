Most consonants are pronounced differently at the end of a syllable, and when
two consonants come into contact across syllable boundaries, a great deal of
assimilation often occurs. In 18th century Malacca Lauvìnko, /ts ʋ l/ become 
[s w ɽ], and stops and nasals lose all distinct place of articulation. /m n ŋ/
assimilate completely to a following consonant’s place of articulation, and are
pronounced [ŋ] or as nasalization word-finally. Coda stops /p t k/ assume a
variety of realizations. They assimilate completely to a following obstruent /p
t t͡s k s/, resulting in a geminate consonant /pp tt tt͡s kk ss/. Before sonorants
/m n ŋ l ʋ/ or word-finally, stops become either a fricative - [h] after /a/, [ç]
after /e i/, and [hʷ] after /o/ - or a stop [ʔ], or even devoice or spirantize the
following sound to [m̥ː n̥ː ŋ̥ː ɬː fː]. A stop or affricate coda followed by /j/
becomes a geminate alveolopalatal affricate [tt͡ɕ]. /j/ also palatalizes other
sounds - /lj sj/ are [λː ɕː] and nasal + /j/ becomes [ɲː]. Coda /l/, normally
pronounced as a retroflex flap [ɽ], shifts following coronals to retroflex - /ln
lt lt͡s ls ll/ are [ɳː ʈː ʈʈ͡ʂ ʂː lː~ɭː].

/h/ can only occur at the beginning of a word. If a word beginning in /h/
receives a prefix, the /h/ is deleted. Some class words begin in /h/, which is
also deleted when the class word is enclitic.
