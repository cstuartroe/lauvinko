The North Wind and the Sun were arguing over who was stronger, when a traveler in a warm shawl came by.

This sentence shows off several pretty interesting features of Lauvìnko. The
first I want to point out is the somewhat ideophonic use of the frequentative
aspect in `lv;ra North.$na$=$vol$=gust.$fqnp$.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$` “North Wind”
and `lv;ra $dep$-mighty.$fqnp$.$na$=$sea$.$na$` “mighty,” which in both cases
serves to colorfully illustrate a high level of intensity. Neither stem would be
likely to appear outside of spoken narrative.

Also, the use of incorporated
`lv;ra speak.$imnp$.$na$` “speak” in the term
`lv;ra speak.$imnp$.$na$=$dat$=$t3ap$-$tvol$-fight.$impt$.$na$` “argue” shows off an
interesting use of incorporation where the incorporated bit has a relationship
to the main stem not easily mappable to a case role.

They agreed that the one who first made the traveler take his shawl off should be considered the strongest.
