I followed along the [Lexember festivities](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/z91a1h/introducing_lexember_2022/)
on /r/conlangs.

# Day 1

```
Cut.$pt$.$na$=$lea$.$pl$.$na$-$gen$ $mir$ black.$gn$.$na$ $ins$=$t3is:swrf$-$tloc$-obscure.$gn$.$na$=$sea$.$na$!

The pages are smudged with ink!
```

I coined two new roots for this sentence:

- [ìsing](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@cut) "Cut, slice, castrate, intersect."

- [sòlang](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@obscure) "Obscure, impede, block, prevent, smudge, cloud."

And two new compound words, one from a new root and one from an existing root:

- [òsimo](/build?outline=cut.%24pt%24.%24na%24%3D%24lea%24.%24sg%24.%24na%24&language=lv&translation=page) "page" 

- [yóvani](/build?outline=black.%24gn%24.%24na%24%3D%24sea%24.%24na%24&language=lv&translation=ink) "ink"

# Day 2

```
$Age$=wise.$gn$.$au$=$3rd$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ $1excl$.$sg$.$na$-$all$ help.$pf$.$na$ $gen$=$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-request.$pt$.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

The expert asked me for help.
```

I coined two new roots for this sentence:

- [éani](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@request) "request"

- [ànosi](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@help) "help"

And one new compound word from an existing root:
 
- [mancáyto](/build?outline=%24age%24%3Dwise.%24gn%24.%24au%24%3D%24hea%24.%24sg%24.%24au%24&language=lv&translation=wise+one%2C+guru%2C+expert) "wise one, guru, expert"

# Day 3

```
Storehouse.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$ this.$na$ $1excl$.$sg$.$au$-$age$ $all$=go.$pf$.$na$ and:$st$ ground.$au$=$lea$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ banteng.$na$=parent:animal.$gn$.$na$=$dim$ $st$-$tloc$-lie:$sg$.$pt$.$na$.

I entered the barn and there was a banteng calf lying on the ground. 
```

I coined two new native roots for this sentence:

- [tòng](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@parent:animal) "To procreate (of an animal)."

- [néni](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@ground) "Ground, floor."

I also borrowed one word from Malay:

- [pánang](/loanword_dictionary?q=@banteng) "[banteng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banteng)"

And one from Sanskrit भाण्डशाला *bhāṇḍaśālā* (which is also loaned into Malay as the word *bangsal*):

- [pánsar](/loanword_dictionary?q=@storehouse) "Barn, storehouse, dormitory, barracks."

I was unsure how to go about forming the names of baby animals. On one hand, giving every type of baby animal its own unrelated name (like English calf, kid, piglet, puppy, etc.) seemed too simple. On the other hand, regularly deriving all baby animal names from the name of the adult seemed to simplistic as well. To resolve this question, I looked into what Lauvìnko's control languages - Malay, Malayalam, and Tamil - do. It turns out all three of them just regularly derive them from <name of adult animal> + "baby" (or the reverse order, depending on head direction). So, that's what I decided to do: <name of adult animal> + *tòng*.

```
Much.$au$=$rck$.$au$-$loc$ foul.$gn$.$na$! $2Fml$.$sg$.$au$-$age$ Foul.$gn$.$na$ can-must-$st$-$tgen$-name.$gn$.$na$.

What a stench! You should call her Stinky.
```

I created one new root for this sentence:

- [ngéni](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@foul) "Stinky, having a stench, unclean, rotten, morally reprehensible, having a bad reputation."

# Day 4

```
Sago_palm.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$ this.$na$ quite large.$pt$.$na$, and:$st$ trunk.$na$ $st$-$tloc$-split.$pt$.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$.

The sago palm was rather large, and its trunk was split.
```

I coined four new roots for this sentence:

- [kìveng](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@sago_palm) "sago palm"

- [nàumang](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@large) "large"

- [íati](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@trunk) "Torso, trunk (of a tree), neck (of a stringed instrument), pipe, flute."

- [ngayír](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@split) "Split, broken, torn."

---

```
$Hort$ interior.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$gen$ see.$pf$.$na$! $2Fml$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ that.$na$ sago.$na$=$sea$.$na$-$par$-$def$ hurry.$gn$.$na$ $gen$=can-$st$-$tage$-cook.$pf$.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$.

Look inside! You could make pudding with that starch.
```

I coined two new roots for this sentence:

- [vánso](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@sago) "Sago pith, starch (from any plant)."

- [cés](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@cook) "Cook, prepare."

This was a fun one because I got to use a throwback to [last year's Lexember](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/r6d6rj/lexember_2021_day_1/hmw8cy8/)!

# Day 5

```
$Ins$=grow.$pf$.$au$=$3rd$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ may_not stone.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$par$ five.$na$ $gen$=$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-play.$pf$.$na$! Much.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$abl$ $indir$-$st$-$tage$-skilled.$gn$.$na$!

The grownup can't play five-stones! He'd be too good!
```

I coined two new roots for this sentence:

- [tàvi](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@play) "Move back and forth, fluctuate, flicker. ۞ Dance, cavort. ۞ Fool about, tinker with. ۞ Play a game. ۞ Be shifty, untrustworthy. ۞ Try to deceive someone."

- [màyyah](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@skilled) "Skilled, proficient, clever, dexterous."

I coined a new compound word:

- [oasítto](/build?outline=%24ins%24%3Dgrow.%24pf%24.%24au%24%3D%24hea%24.%24sg%24.%24au%24&language=lv&translation=adult) "adult"

as well as the new adverbial construction

- [pó](/build?outline=much.%24na%24%3D%24rck%24.%24na%24-%24abl%24&language=lv&translation=too) "too (excessively)"

I also expanded the use of the indirect evidential *coy-* for this sentence. Already used for inference, I decided to use it here for the "would be" sense, with the justification that it's a sort of deduction or supposition in this context.

The game the children are playing is a game [a bit like jacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knucklebones#Austronesia) called *[batu seremban](https://weefolkart.com/homeschool/batu-seremban-game-directions/)* in Malay.

# Day 6

```
$T3is:swrf$-$tloc$-sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$ table.$au$=$lea$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ under.$au$=$rck$.$au$-$loc$ $refl$.$na$-$par$ $age$=$dep$-hide.$gn$.$na$ chicken.$na$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$... $int$ $2fml$.$sg$.$na$ $abl$=sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$?

There's a chicken hiding under the table, is that yours?
```

I coined three new roots for this sentence:

- [néu](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@under) "under"

- [ngòmo](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@table) "Plank, board, table."

- [màlo](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@hide) "Fit, squeeze into. ۞ (reflexive) Hide from. ۞ Conceal, disguise, not admit. ۞ Bury, stash. ۞ Be invisible."

I think this is the first time, or at least the first time since making several syntax changes, that I've decided how to do an existential construction. What I've settled on makes use of the heretofore rarely-used post-verbal focus position: the sentence begins with a verb *saposnì* marked for a new third-person trigger despite no overt trigger being stated, and the verb essentially means "it is there/it has", and the thing (in this case, a chicken hiding under a table) comes in the focus position.

I also played with cases in a new way here. Normally, the locative case is used for alienable possession, but it doesn't seem right to mark "you" with the locative in this situation, where the chicken has escaped its owner. So, I translated "yours" using the ablative case, with the idea that the chicken was *from* the chef at some earlier point in time.

# Day 7

```
First.$na$ narrow.$gn$.$na$=$rck$.$na$, and:$swrf$ after:$swrf$-wide.$gn$.$na$, and:$swrf$ $abl$=after:$swrf$-narrow.$gn$.$na$, after:$swrf$-wide.$gn$.$na$, after:$swrf$-narrow.$gn$.$na$, and:$swrf$ face.$au$=$rck$.$au$-$loc$ $abl$=after:$swrf$-wide.$gn$.$na$.

The first one narrow, then wide, then more narrow, then wide, then narrow, then lastly more wide.
```

I coined two new roots for this sentence:

- [sórvay](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@wide) "Wide, loose, spacious, imprecise."

- [ayísmi](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@narrow) "Narrow, tight, precise."

This seemingly confusing sentence is describing a
[Porcupine](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Porcupine)-like hexatonic scale for
a tuning system like [15-EDO](https://en.xen.wiki/w/15edo) or
[22-EDO](https://en.xen.wiki/w/22edo). I use such scales in my own
music, and given that the South Asian music theoretical concept of
a [shruti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shruti_(music)) involves
dividing an octave into 22 pieces, it's quite reasonable to expect that
the Lauvìnko would be prepared to work with such a scale.

This sentence marks the first time I've used an ablative applicative
to form a morphological intensive/comparative. I've strayed away from
morphological comparatives in the past since they're rather rare outside
Europe, but this is not a dedicated comparative affix, and the semantics
follow very naturally from the rest of the grammar, so it feels justified
to me.

# Day 8

```
$3Rd$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ $pro$-$dep$-sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$ build.$pf$.$au$=$lea$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ ground.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$all$ weave.$pf$.$na$ $t1s$-$tage$-lie:$sg$.$gn$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$.

I laid a rug on the floor in his future house.
```

Today I coined... no new roots!

However, this is the first time I've committed a couple of new types of
constructions to writing. The first is applying aspect/relative tense
to possession, in this case with the word `lv;fr $pro$-$dep$-sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$`.
The other is using a positional with a causative construction to mean
something like "put."

# Day 9

```
After:$swrf$-proverb.$na$, what.$na$ mushroom.$na$=$bra$.$pl$.$na$ $int$ $ins$=yellow.$inc$.$na$?

Wait, which mushrooms get you high?
```

I coined one new root for this sentence:

- [kérni](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@mushroom) "Mushroom."

I also coined the new composed word

- [nonòs](/build?outline=after%3A%24swrf%24-proverb.%24na%24&language=lv&translation=anyway) "Anyway, so, well"

The sense of "get high" for the stem [ngìng](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@yellow) is
actually quite old - I believe I coined it in 2016 or 2017.

# Day 10

```
After:$swrf$-proverb.$na$... pleasant.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$gen$ $indir$-$t1s$-$tage$-seem.$gn$.$na$ goat.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$!

Well... the goat looks tasty!
```

I coined three new roots for this sentence:

- [áyka](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@pleasant) "Tasty, pleasant, lekker."

- [mày](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@seem) "Seem, feel, appear."

- [sòngi](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@goat) "Goat."

*áyka* is the first instance where I've created an uninflected rather
than stative stem for something that I translate with an English
adjective. I'm not sure why it felt right to me - I suppose I thought
of it more as a thing: a tasty treat, something nice. I also have
a hard time imagining a use case for the inceptive aspect with this
stem - things don't normally just become pleasant without some other
process going on.

I spent a while debating how to convey the "looks" sense. I didn't
think that the strategy Malay uses would fit well. I thought about
making *áyka* the finite verb of the sentence, and forming some kind
of adverbial from `lv;r see.$imnp$.$na$` "see." Then I looked at Malayalam and it
decided to do something similar for Lauvìnko here. The finite verb
means "seem, appear" and the thing it seems like is an oblique -
in Lauvìnko's case, a genitive. I extended the availability of
case roles a bit more by allowing an agentive-case perceiver - in
this sentence, it's the speaker.

I did one last new thing here, in that I used the indirect evidential
in a situation where there is obviously direct evidence - the speaker
is stating their own opinion. However, I thought it could be used
to soften the opinion a bit, as though allowing room for disagreement.
This is an awkward date, after all - the speaker wouldn't want to come
on too strong.

---

```
Oh... $int$ meat.$na$ not-$t2s:swrf$-$tage$-eat.$fqnp$.$na$=$bra$.$sg$.$na$-$pat$?

Oh... you don't eat meat?
```

I coined one new root for this sentence:

- [ngàni](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@meat) "Meat, flesh, muscle."

---

```
$3Rd$.$sg$.$au$-$age$ this.$na$=manner.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$prl$
$dep$-proverb.$na$=$rck$.$na$ this.$na$ much.$na$ or?

Does she do this kind of thing a lot?
```

# Day 11

```
$Loc$=work.$imnp$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$gen$ ground.$au$=$lea$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ $3rd$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ $dep$-lens.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$abl$ $dep$-glass.$na$ break.$pt$.$na$ $t3is:swrf$-$tloc$-be:$pl$.$pt$.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

The shards of glass from her lens were on the floor of the workshop.
```

I coined two new native roots for this sentence:

- [ásimay](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@work) "Work, labor."

- [sílo](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@break) "Break, smash, shatter."

I also loaned a new word from Sanskrit
[काचक](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%95#Sanskrit):

- [kásah](/loanword_dictionary?q=@glass) "Glass."

Most excitingly, today marks my first-ever Dutch loanword into Lauvìnko!
It required fair bit of code wrangling to make it work.

- [lènsa](/loanword_dictionary?q=@lens) "Lens," from Dutch *lens*

---

```
$T1s$-$tage$-go.$pf$.$na$ in_order-$t1s$-$tage$-pick_up.$pt$.$na$.

I went to pick them up.
```

I coined one new native root for this sentence:

- [néh](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@pick_up) "Pick up."

---

```
Glue.$na$=$sea$.$na$-$ins$ $indir$-not-want-$t2s:swrf$-$tage$-bind.$gn$.$na$, no?

I guess you don't want to glue them back together, huh?
```

I coined one new native root for this sentence:

- [náli](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@bind) "Bind, adhere, fasten, stay together."

I also took another Dutch loanword:

- [làyma](/loanword_dictionary?q=@glue) "Glue," from Dutch *lijm*

# Day 12

```
Help.$pf$.$na$ batik.$na$ silk.$na$ trousers.$na$ want-$t1s$-$tloc$-sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$.

I'd like the silk batik trousers please.
```

I loaned three new roots into Lauvìnko today, from three different languages!

- [pàtih](/loanword_dictionary?q=@batik) "Batik," from Javanese

- [sìtiu](/loanword_dictionary?q=@silk) "Silk fabric," from Hokkien

- [salòala](/loanword_dictionary?q=@trousers) "Trousers," from Malay

I also coined a new usage for *ènosi* "help", to mean "please." This is
a direct calque of Malay *tolong*.

# Day 13

```
Who.$na$-$gen$ $int$ $1excl$.$sg$.$na$-$abl$ $loc$=scratch.$imnp$.$na$ want-$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-steal.$pt$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$?

Who would want to steal my notebook?
```

Today I coined one new stem:

- [èniki](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@steal) "Steal."

I also coined one new composed word:

- [pocèsako](/build?outline=%24loc%24%3Dscratch.%24imnp%24.%24na%24%3D%24lea%24.%24sg%24.%24na%24&language=lv&translation=notebook) "Notebook."

# Day 14

```
What.$na$=much.$na$=$rck$.$na$ this.$na$ gold.$na$=$sea$.$na$-$gen$ price.$na$=$rck$.$na$?

What's the price of gold?
```

Today I took two loanwords from Sanskrit, both of which have cognates
in Malay:

- [màs](/loanword_dictionary?q=@gold) "Gold."

- [èlanka](/loanword_dictionary?q=@price) "Price."

# Day 15

```
Pull.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$pl$.$na$-$gen$ banteng.$au$=$hea$.$pl$.$au$-$gen$ skin.$na$ $t1p$-$tage$-craft.$pf$.$na$=$bra$.$pl$.$na$.

We made drums from banteng hide.
```

I made one new root:

- [tènni](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@craft) "Make something small with the hands."

I also created one new compound word:

- [píto](/build?outline=pull.%24pf%24.%24na%24%3D%24lea%24.%24sg%24.%24na%24&language=lv&translation=drum) "Drum."

# Day 16

```
$Loc$=sand.$na$ edge.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$gen$ $t3is:swrf$-$tloc$-sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$ tree.$na$ build.$pf$.$na$=$dim$.

On the sandy beach there's a wooden cottage.
```

I made two new roots:

- [tòne](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@sand) "Sand, grit, dust."

- [yèuti](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@edge) "Rim, edge, shore."

When used as a relational noun, *yèuti* is in rock class, but here it is marked with
leaf class as it denotes a location, a seashore.

For this sentence I used a new type of construction, where I use a locative applicative
with a comitative-like meaning.

# Day 17

```
$Loc$=be:$pl$.$gn$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$ $int$ Atineni.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$abl$ east.$na$ south.$au$=$lea$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ lie:$sg$.$gn$.$na$?

The capsule is southeast of Atineni?
```

I created two new roots:

- [navór](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@east) "east"

- [áytoy](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@south) "south"

I already had a root meaning "north" from translating *The North Wind and the Sun*, so
I created one more to round out the set:

- [ípi](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@west) "west"

I spent a long while debating how to do secondary cardinals in Lauvìnko. I've always
admired languages which do something other than straightforward combination of
an east/west term and a north/south term. Malay has different words for north/south
for secondary cardinals (e.g. "north" = *utara*, "west" = *barat*, but
"northwest" = *barat laut*) and a unique monomorphemic term for "southeast". Finnish
has unique monomorphemic terms for all secondary cardinals. However, doing anything
weird like this appears to be extremely rare. Tagalog and all the South Asian languages
I looked at just form secondary cardinals compositionally. For now, I just decided to
take this straightforward approach, using the same order as Malay - east/west before
north/south.

---

```
$Prl$=sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$ that.$na$ mountain.$au$=$dim$-$loc$ top.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

It's just over that hill.
```

I made one root for this sentence:

- [sáuna](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@mountain) "Mountain, hill."

# Day 18

```
$1Excl$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ head.$au$=$bra$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ top.$na$=$rck$.$na$-$gen$
$t3is:swrf$-$tloc$-sit:$sg$.$pt$.$na$... dhole.$na$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$!

On top of my head was sitting... a dhole!
```

I made one root for this sentence:

- [hònti](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@dhole) "Dhole."

[Dholes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhole) are the only canids endemic to the
region.

# Day 19

```
All-$par$ must-$dep$-order.$na$=$rck$.$na$ $loc$=sit:$sg$.$gn$.$na$.

I need to tidy everything up.
```

I made one root for this sentence:

- [lòngang.](/kasanic_dictionary?q=@order) "Neat, tidy, correct, appropriate, fitting."

This is the first time I've used a long-theorized construction: periphrastically
indicating aspect for uninflected stems.
