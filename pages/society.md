A Lauvìnko civilization as such didn’t properly exist after the founding of
Malacca. Certainly, no formal government of a Lauvìnko state ever existed,
save perhaps for the semi-legendary preeminence of Socyàng in earliest
history. Being a perpetual minority following the urbanization of their
homelands, Lauvìnko people generally merely assimilated as members of the
broader cosmopolitan society surrounding them, and fulfilled roles ranging
from sustenance farmers and fishers to wealthy merchants, accountants, or
other professionals. Even so, within urban areas Lauvìnko people tended to
live within specifically Lauvìnko neighborhoods, to keep their own temples,
which also served as centers of community, culture, and ethnic records and
literature, and generally to retain a vibrant, cohesive subcultural identity.
