Lauvinko was written in both the Palavaytòlis, 
a native Brahmic writing system, and
the Latin alphabet historically. Use of the native script dates to
the 9^{th} century and constitutes a formal literary tradition, while
informal use of the Latin alphabet began with the first European colonization
in the 16^{th} century and never fully displaced the Palavaytòlis.

In this document, I use a standardized romanization scheme which does
not closely resemble any historical scheme for writing Lauvinko with
the Latin alphabet.
