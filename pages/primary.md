Lauvìnko stems exhibit marking of a past vs. non-past tense
distinction, a so-called **primary** perfective-imperfective aspect
distinction, and **secondary** inceptive and frequentative aspects.
The idiomatic
meaning and use of the aspects varies according to the lexical aspect
of stems.

The marking (or lack thereof) of these distinctions
is the only sense in which Lauvìnko might be said
to show an obvious morphological distinction between stems that are
noun-like, adjective-like, and verb-like, although the split may be
better described as being based on lexical aspect.
Lauvìnko stems are grouped into four categories based
on which distinctions they show: **fientive**, **punctual**, **stative**,
and **uninflected**. The morphological category of a Lauvìnko stem
is roughly predictable based on semantics, although semantic drift has
yielded some stems with less predictable relationships between semantics
and morphology.

I will describe the four
stem categories beginning with the fientive stems, which
exhibit the maximal set of distinctions; other stem categories will
largely be described via subtraction from the fientive paradigm.

# Fientive stems

Fientive stems are those which exhibit a maximal
six-way distinction. Prototypically, they denote actions which are
complex or dynamic.

Tense and primary aspect are marked on fientive stems 
in a three-way distinction:

- Imperfective non-past
- Imperfective past
- Perfective

Perfective stems are not also marked for tense; bare perfective stems default
to a past-tense interpretation, although a future-tense interpretation
is possible if obvious from context.

Tense and primary aspect were marked via vowel ablaut in the
first syllable of the stem in Proto-Kasanic,
which usually appears simply as ablaut as well in Lauvìnko. There is
a low-vowel paradigm which varied **a**-**o**-**e** in Proto-Kasanic,
typically surfacing as *a*-*o*-*e* in Lauvìnko:

| `lv;fr weave.$imnp$.$na$` "weave" |         Non-past          |           Past            |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Imperfective                      | `lv;fr weave.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr weave.$impt$.$na$` |
| Perfective                        |             +             |  `lv;fr weave.$pf$.$na$`  |

There is also a high-vowel paradigm which varied **ə**-**u**-**i**
in Proto-Kasanic, typically
surfacing as *e*-*o*-*i* in Lauvìnko:

| `lv;fr sing.$imnp$.$na$` "sing" |         Non-past         |           Past           |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Imperfective                    | `lv;fr sing.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr sing.$impt$.$na$` |
| Perfective                      |            +             |  `lv;fr sing.$pf$.$na$`  |

| `lv;fr depict.$imnp$.$na$` "depict, draw, plan" |          Non-past          |            Past            |
|:------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Imperfective                                    | `lv;fr depict.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr depict.$impt$.$na$` |
| Perfective                                      |             +              |  `lv;fr depict.$pf$.$na$`  |

Due to historical sound change, some Lauvìnko stems inflect irregularly for
tense and primary aspect.

| `lv;fr put.$imnp$.$na$` "throw" |        Non-past         |          Past           |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Imperfective                    | `lv;fr put.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr put.$impt$.$na$` |
| Perfective                      |            +            |  `lv;fr put.$pf$.$na$`  |

Fientive lexemes may be lexically telic or atelic. For telic meanings,
the perfective often implies completion of the action by default,
while the imperfective implies lack of completion:

| `lv;fr eat.$imnp$.$na$` "eat" |                       Non-past                       |                      Past                      |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|
| Imperfective                  | `lv;fr eat.$imnp$.$na$` "she is eating (some of) it" | `lv;fr eat.$impt$.$na$` "she ate (some of) it" |
| Perfective                    |                          +                           |  `lv;fr eat.$pf$.$na$` "she ate (all of) it"   |

| `lv;fr search.$imnp$.$na$` "search" |                       Non-past                       |                       Past                       |
|:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Imperfective                        | `lv;fr search.$imnp$.$na$` "she is searching for it" | `lv;fr search.$impt$.$na$` "she searched for it" |
| Perfective                          |                          +                           |     `lv;fr search.$pf$.$na$` "she found it"      |

---

**Secondary aspect** is a designation for two more aspects - frequentative
and inceptive - which are formed by prefixing onto a primary stem. In
addition to the three primary stem forms, there are three secondary forms
(for a total of six forms of a fientive stem):

- Inceptive
- Frequentative non-past
- Frequentative past

The inceptive denotes beginning an action.
It patterns as a perfective, in that it does not
distinguish tense, defaulting to a past-tense interpretation
but also being used for future.
It is formed via prefixing *i-* onto the central-vowel-grade
stem:

| `lv;fr put.$imnp$.$na$` "throw" | Non-past |          Past          |
|:--------------------------------|:--------:|:----------------------:|
| Inceptive                       |    +     | `lv;fr put.$inc$.$na$` |

The inceptive prefix triggers nasal mutation:

| `lv;fr weave.$imnp$.$na$` "weave" | Non-past |           Past           |
|:----------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------------:|
| Inceptive                         |    +     | `lv;fr weave.$inc$.$na$` |

Conversely, the frequentative patterns as an imperfective, and distinguishes
past from non-past. It was formed in Proto-Kasanic by reduplicating
the first consonant-vowel
pair before the first syllable, using the front-vowel-grade stem for non-past
and the back-vowel-grade stem for past:

| `lv;fr weave.$imnp$.$na$` "weave" |         Non-past          |           Past            |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Frequentative                     | `lv;fr weave.$fqnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr weave.$fqpt$.$na$` |

As always, due to historical sound change, it is not always as simple as
repeating the first consonant-vowel pair in Lauvìnko.
For instance, the reflex of Proto-Kasanic **u** is *a* in unaccented
syllables:

| `lv;fr put.$imnp$.$na$` "throw" |        Non-past         |          Past           |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Frequentative                   | `lv;fr put.$fqnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr put.$fqpt$.$na$` |

The frequentative reduplication prefix does not trigger mutation,
but like any conjunct prefix it may trigger [consonant breaking](/mutations).

| `lv;fr sing.$imnp$.$na$` "sing" |         Non-past         |           Past           |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Frequentative                   | `lv;fr sing.$fqnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr sing.$fqpt$.$na$` |

For stems beginning in a vowel, Proto-Kasanic reduplicated the first
vowel-consonant pair, rather than the first consonant-vowel pair. In
Lauvìnko, the two consonants/consonant sequences are frequently different
for non-augment stems, due to post-tonic consonant lenition:

| `lv;fr depict.$imnp$.$na$` "depict, draw, plan" |          Non-past          |            Past            |
|:------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Frequentative                                   | `lv;fr depict.$fqnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr depict.$fqpt$.$na$` |

Frequentative aspect marking can lend at least three distinct types of
shift in meaning; which one is intended depends on context and the
specific stem. Most stems have a specific, idiomatic meaning for the
frequentative.

The first, most directly implied by the name, is repetition:

```
put.$imnp$.$na$; put.$fqnp$.$na$

throw; sow (seeds)
```

```
bite.$np$.$na$; bite.$fqnp$.$na$

bite; chew
```

Secondly, this may be extended to a sort of gnomic aspect:

```
sleep.$imnp$.$na$; sleep.$fqnp$.$na$

sleep; live (in a place)
```

```
eat.$imnp$.$na$; eat.$fqnp$.$na$

be eating; habitually eat, have as a part of one's diet
```

Lastly, some stems use the frequentative for a kind of intensive, often
in addition to one or both of the above senses:

```
grow.$imnp$.$na$; grow.$fqnp$.$na$

grow; multiply, proliferate
```

```
cross.$np$.$na$; cross.$fqnp$.$na$

cross over; wander
```

```
touch.$imnp$.$na$; touch.$fqnp$.$na$

touch; strike
```

```
speak.$imnp$.$na$; speak.$fqnp$.$na$

speak; issue commands
```

Some ideophonic stems essentially only appear in the frequentative:

```
mighty.$fqnp$.$na$

mighty
```

# Punctual stems

Punctual stems comprise the least numerous of the four groups of stems.
They typically denote semelfactive, instantaneous actions,
and do not exhibit a primary aspect distinction, nor an inceptive
aspect. The basic form of the stem is considered essentially
perfective, and punctual stems do mark the frequentative aspect.

Unlike fientive stems, punctuals mark tense in the perfective
as well as in the frequentative. As with fientive stems,
pucntual stems use a front-vowel-grade form for the
frequentative non-past stem and a back-vowel-grade form for
the frequentative past; for punctual stems, the same pattern
holds for the perfectives:

| `lv;fr insert.$np$.$na$` "insert, pierce" |                      Non-past                      |                     Past                     |
|:------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| Perfective                                |              `lv;fr insert.$np$.$na$`              |           `lv;fr insert.$pt$.$na$`           |
| Frequentative                             |             `lv;fr insert.$fqnp$.$na$`             |          `lv;fr insert.$fqpt$.$na$`          |

Punctuals have both low and high vowel ablaut paradigms, as with
fientives. The frequentative lends the same types of semantic shifts
to punctual stems as to fientive ones. The frequentative of a punctual
stem may also be used to give a plain imperfective sense.

# Stative stems

Stative stems are those which were at one point prior to Proto-Kasanic
uninflected, and to which a reduced set of verbal morphology then became
analogized. They are usually translatable into English as adjectives,
or as verbs which have no kinetic component, such as verbs of emotion.

Rather than an imperfective non-past form, statives have a so-called
"general" form, which may have a basic, episodic nonpast sense
or a more general, gnomic sense.

```
yellow.$gn$.$na$

have fun/be a fun person
```

Because stative stems began by having no internal inflection, there
is no particular vowel that marks the general form; any vowel
may appear as the first vowel of the general form of a stative stem.
The past tense was analogized to stative stems in Proto-Kasanic by
replacing the first vowel or diphthong with **o** or **u**, depending
on the height of the original vowel. In Lauvìnko, this almost always
appears as *o*.

| `lv;fr yellow.$gn$.$na$` "yellow, fun" |         General          |           Past           |
|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Imperfective                           | `lv;fr yellow.$gn$.$na$` | `lv;fr yellow.$pt$.$na$` |

For stems which already had a first vowel of **o** or **u** in Proto-Kasanic,
the past is the same as the general:

| `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$gn$.$na$` "lie, be" |          General           |            Past            |
|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Imperfective                         | `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$gn$.$na$` | `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$pt$.$na$` |

However, they may still be categorized as stative rather than uninfected,
because they have the
third and final stem form characteristic of statives: the inceptive. To
mark the inceptive, statives use the same *i-* prefix (triggering nasal
mutation) as fientives, affixing onto the general stem:

| `lv;fr yellow.$gn$.$na$` "yellow, fun" |         General          |           Past            |
|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Inceptive                              |            +             | `lv;fr yellow.$inc$.$na$` |

| `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$gn$.$na$` "lie, be" | General |            Past             |
|:-------------------------------------|:-------:|:---------------------------:|
| Inceptive                            |    +    | `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$inc$.$na$` |

(note that although these stems both have a *nk* sequence before the accented
vowel, in the case of `lv;fr yellow.$inc$.$na$` it is merely consonant
breaking,
while for `lv;fr lie:$sg$.$inc$.$na$` it is a nasal mutation on plain *k*.)

# Uninflected stems

As the name suggests, uninflected stems are those which undergo no
primary or secondary tense or aspect inflection. This is not to say
that they cannot be subject to any type of inflection - like all
stems, they may take other conjunct stems, including
[tertiary aspect](/tertiary). 

This is the most numerous category of stems, by far.
Prototypical uninflected stems include
native terms with noun-like meanings, but also all loanwords, with the
exception of some Sanskrit loans which were adopted early and given
stative morphology by analogy, like other stative stems. Uninflected
stems with verb-like meanings must express aspect
[periphrastically](/periphrastic_aspect).
