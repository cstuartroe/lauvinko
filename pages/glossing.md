On this site, interlinear glosses are auto-generated by the morphological
engine. Please let me know if you find a broken gloss!

Glosses are visually set apart from the descriptive text by a neat little
green border.
They contain up to six lines – original text in *Palavaytòlis*,
romanization,
broad phonemic transcription, narrow phonetic transcription,
morphological breakdown, and finally a translation.
I'm working on adding a line showing the underlying phonological
value of each morpheme!

```lv;frbna
Cart.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$all$ mango.$na$ $t1s$-$tvol$-add.$fqpt$.$na$=$bra$.$pl$.$na$.

I loaded the mangoes into the cart.
```

However, I'll usually omit the broad and narrow transcriptions.

All grammatical features are represented in small caps. Fusional
morphemes with multiple semantic and grammatical features are glossed
with these features separated by a period (.). The most common cases of fusion
appear in class words, which represent noun class and number fusionally with
mostly unpredictable forms, in verbal stems, which mark primary tense and
aspect via vowel ablaut, and in the marking of augment on all stems and class
words via synchronically unpredictable phonological changes toward the
beginning of the stem.

# Morphophonological binding

In the morphological breakdown section of a gloss,
there are two degrees of binding between morphemes:

- Morphemes within a syntactic word are joined with a dash (-);
this includes the binding between most verbal prefixes
(so-called **conjunct prefixes**) and the stem,
as well as the binding between class words and case suffixes.
- Phonological words are very recognizable in Lauvìnko by multiple criteria.
I regard many of them to consist of multiple syntactically independent words;
the binding between syntactic words is given by an equal sign (=). Words
phonologically bound to a content word in this way include enclitic class
words, as well as applicative prefixes and incorporated nouns
(**disjunct prefixes**).

This distinction may seem arbitrary at first, but in fact it
is quite clear cut, for two reasons:
- Although words joined by an = are phonologically connected, they may
always appear as phonologically unbounded words in some contexts
(note the distribution of cart.$na$ and $lea$.$sg$.$na$ in the examples 
below). In contrast,
conjunct prefixes may never appear as independent words.

```
$1excl$.$sg$.$au$-$vol$ cart.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$dat$ $dep$-search.$pf$.$na$

(that) I found the cart
```

```
$1excl$.$sg$.$au$-$vol$ $lea$.$sg$.$na$-$dat$ $dep$-search.$pf$.$na$

(that) I found it
```

```
cart.$na$ $dat$=$t1s$-$tvol$-search.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$

I found the cart
```

- The morphophonological rules governing the joining of morphemes
within a syntactic word are categorically different and more
complex than those which take place when syntactically independent
words become phonologically enclitic/proclitic on one another.

```
$t3as$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

he spoke
```

```
$dat$=$t3as$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

he spoke about it
```

```
if-$t3as$-$tvol$-speak.$pf$.$na$

if he spoke
```
