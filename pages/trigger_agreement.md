Lauvìnko morphosyntax is similar to so-called Philippine-type
alignment, in that one argument is selected as having a special
role within the sentence, and that special argument may have one
of several semantic roles. The "special argument" has been called
by several names in Austronesian linguistics, including "subject",
"topic", and "trigger"; I prefer the term **trigger**, as both of the
other terms have more general meanings outside Austronesian linguistics
which do not closely describe the role of this argument.

Unlike Philippine languages, Lauvìnko verbs also generally agree
with the person and number of the trigger. Also unlike Philippine
languages, a patient cannot be the trigger, and in fact trigger
role marking cannot be said to be fully symmetrical, in that
an agent role for the trigger is zero-marked. In these senses,
Lauvìnko trigger agreement bears somewhat more resemblance to
more typical subject marking.

In Lauvìnko, the trigger generally occupies the discourse role
of a topic - it the main matter which is being commented upon,
and must *always* be definite, either by way of being previously
introduced into discourse or being present in common awareness.
There is a moderately strong preference for preserving the same
trigger across multiple sentences, and person and number are only
overtly marked for new triggers (a form of switch-reference marking)
for all but first-person triggers. Because its person and
number are marked on the verb, it is very common for the trigger
not to be overtly stated; generally, the trigger is only
present as an argument in the sentence if it is both a
full noun phrase (not a pronoun) and if it was not the trigger
of preceding sentences. When the trigger is overtly mentioned, it
is always the first phrase of the sentence, and is marked with the
genitive case.

# Marking the person and number of the trigger

When a sentence is the first in an utterance, or has a different
referent as trigger than the previous sentence, the trigger is always
overtly marked. The paradigm of prefixes is:

|                        | Singular | Plural |
|:-----------------------|:--------:|:------:|
| First person           |  *na-*   | *ka-*  |
| Second person          |  *i^F-*  | *e^F-* |
| Third person animate   |   *a-*   |  *o-*  |
| Third person inanimate |  *sa-*   | *so-*  |

The second person prefixes trigger a fortition mutation.

An example with agentive trigger (for which the case role is zero-marked):

| `lv;fr put.$imnp$.$na$` "throw" |                  Singular                  |                   Plural                   |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| First person                    |    `lv;fr $t1s$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$`    |    `lv;fr $t1p$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$`    |
| Second person                   | `lv;fr $t2s:swrf$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$`  | `lv;fr $t2p:swrf$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$`  |
| Third person animate            | `lv;fr $t3as:swrf$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr $t3ap:swrf$-$tage$-put.$imnp$.$na$` |
| Third person inanimate          |                                            |                                            |

Forms agreeing with inanimate triggers are ungrammatical in this case,
because inanimates may not be agents, and can never occupy an agentive
theta role. An example with genitive trigger:

| `lv;fr see.$imnp$.$na$` "see" |                  Singular                  |                   Plural                   |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| First person                  |    `lv;fr $t1s$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$`    |    `lv;fr $t1p$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$`    |
| Second person                 | `lv;fr $t2s:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$`  | `lv;fr $t2p:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$`  |
| Third person animate          | `lv;fr $t3as:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr $t3ap:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$` |
| Third person inanimate        | `lv;fr $t3is:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$` | `lv;fr $t3ip:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$imnp$.$na$` |

Note that trigger agreement only distinguishes two numbers - singular and
plural. This contrasts with the three-way singular/dual/plural distinction
of some [class words](/class). Dual and plural triggers are marked identically
on the verb; the discrepancy in number marking strategies is historical.
Verb agreement with trigger number is the much older morphological
system; dual-number class words originate from the grammaticalization
of measure words which specifically connoted pairs of things.

---

For non-first-person triggers, the agreement prefix ceases to be used
after the first clause for which it is the trigger. In such cases,
I mark the trigger agreement slot with $st$ ("same trigger").

```
Bake.$pf$.$na$ $t2s:swrf$-$tloc$-sit.$pt$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$, after:$st$-$st$-$tage$-put.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$.

You had a brick, then you threw it.
```

```
Bake.$pf$.$na$ $t1s$-$tloc$-sit.$pt$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$, after:$st$-$t1s$-$tage$-put.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$.

I had a brick, then I threw it.
```

# Marking the role of the trigger

The case role of the trigger is marked by a prefix which comes after
the person/number agreement prefix.
I often refer to this marking as "voice", to distinguish it from the
"trigger agreement" marking person and number.

The three case roles which the trigger may have are:

* [Agentive case](/agentive): the case used for intentional 
agents of transitive
and intransitive verbs. This is zero-marked in Lauvìnko.

```
bake.$pf$.$na$ $st$-$tage$-put.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$

They threw the brick.
```

```
bake.$pf$.$na$ $gen$=$t3ap:swrf$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$

They saw the brick.
```

* [Genitive case](/genitive): the genitive case has many functions
in Lauvìnko (including marking the trigger!) but as a theta role on
the verb it generally marks objects of perception or cognition.
This is marked with a prefix *ta-* which triggers nasal mutation.

```
bake.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$-$gen$ $age$=$t3is:swrf$-$tgen$-see.$pf$.$na$=$3rd$.$pl$.$na$

The brick was seen by them.
```

* [Locative case](/adpositional): as a primary argument of the sentence,
locative is most often used for possessors. This is marked with the
prefix *pos-*.

```
bake.$pf$.$na$ $st$-$tloc$-sit.$gn$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$

They have a brick.
```

# Null trigger

It is not infrequent for the speaker to want to maintain something
at the center of discourse which does not occupy one of those three case
roles in a sentence; in such cases, the sentence does not use trigger
marking as described in this section. Instead, the topic of the sentence
is marked with the [partitive case](/partitive) and there are no
trigger agreement prefixes on the verb (cf. [](argument_order)).

# Dependence marking

Whether or not a verb has some kind of trigger agreement is a good
test for whether a verb is finite. The only Lauvìnko words which
are unambiguously verbs - or, at any rate, the only Lauvìnko
words which are unambiguously finite verbs - are those which
show topic agreement. This may seem like a difficult test to
apply, given that same topic and agent voice are both zero-marked,
but in fact any word with dependent noun phrases which does not
show topic agreement
is instead overtly marked for dependence with a prefix *et-*.

A frequent use of this prefix is in nominalized clauses.

```
$2fml$.$sg$.$au$-$age$ bake.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$-$par$ $dep$-put.$pf$.$na$ $gen$=$t1s$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$sea$.$na$

I saw you throw a brick.
```

Even semantically very noun-line words which have dependent noun phrases
use the dependence prefix.

```
Malacca.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$-$abl$ $dep$-man.$na$ $gen$=$t1s$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$

I saw the man from Malacca.
```

This includes nouns with locative-case possessors.

```
$2fml$.$sg$.$au$-$loc$ $dep$-bake.$pf$.$na$ $gen$=$t1s$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$sg$.$na$

I saw your brick.
```

The only exception is genitive-case possessors, which are only
for kinship terms.

```
$2fml$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ sister.$na$=$femn$ $gen$=$t1s$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$3rd$.$sg$.$na$

I saw your sister.
```
