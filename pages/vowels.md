Lauvìnko possesses four vowel phonemes /a e i o/. In the most
standard, conservative
realization, in accented open syllables they become [ɑː eː iː oː],
and are [ɐ ɛ ɪ ʊ] elsewhere.

There are also three centering diphthongs /eɐ̯ iɐ̯ oɐ̯/ (pronounced
[ɛɐ̯ ɪɐ̯ ʊɐ] in standard accent) which are considered
closed rimes phonologically. They cannot be followed by a coda consonant.
The sequences /aj oj aʋ eʋ iʋ/, pronounced [ɐj ʊj ɐw ɛw ɪw], occur, but are
considered vowel-consonant sequences rather than diphthongs. In
unaccented syllables /aj aʋ/ might become [ɪ ʊ]. The sequences
/oʋ ej ij/ are not permitted within a single syllable; they are
permitted if the consonant is syllabified as part of the syllable
after the vowel: `lv;frbn wash.$impt$.$na$` "he washed".
