The Lauvìnko practiced a lineage system somewhat similar to the matrilineal
clan reckoning of the Sumatran Minangkabau or the subsection or moeity
systems of some indigenous Australian groups, with a handful of “clans”
(`lv ft clan.$na$=$bra$.$pl$.$na$`) with membership passed from a mother to all
her children. Clan membership was universal among Lauvìnko speakers, and
certain restrictions were imposed by clan. Most importantly, marriage and
certain types of professional partnerships were forbidden between members
of the same clan. In addition, certain trades or occupations were seemingly
limited to members of one or two clans. For instance, trade in cumin was
customarily prohibited except to those of the `lv t ^timi.$na$` 
clan, and high-ranking religious or medicinal figures were typically only 
`lv t ^ngensa.$na$` or `lv t ^kolang.$na$`. As of my
visit, there were sixteen clans, of varying ubiquity and geographic spread,
named with a typically Sanskrit-derived animal name.

`lv ft ^oasang.$na$` (Banteng) was a very common clan in 
the north. Many `lv t ^oasang.$na$`
practiced agriculture, though most occupations seemed to be available to 
them. `lv ft ^keng.$na$` (Bird) was a common clan in the city of Malacca. 
Most `lv t ^keng.$na$`
were fishermen, sailors, or merchants. `lv ft ^sonka.$na$` (Dog) were moderately
common throughout, especially inland. Most `lv t ^sonka.$na$` were farmers. 
`lv ft ^mesi.$na$`
(Fish) were common in the south, and almost always fishermen. 
`lv ft ^singa.$na$`
(Lion) lived mostly in Malacca, and were typically writers, professionals, or
wealthy merchants. According to legend, `lv ft ^sutra.$na$=cart.$na$` 
created the `lv t ^singa.$na$` clan for
himself and his kin, and it certainly carried a socioeconomic prestige into the
18th century. Trade in certain valuable goods, such as pepper, saffron, and
gold, was restricted to `lv t ^singa.$na$`. 
`lv ft ^ngensa.$na$` (Elephant) was moderately common
throughout Lauvìnko territory. Most `lv t ^ngensa.$na$` were scholars, professionals, or
clerics. Contracts were customarily required to include a `lv t ^ngensa.$na$` as a signatory
witness or notary. `lv ft ^treeshrew.$na$` (Treeshrew) were limited to the south, and
typically were farmers. Some `lv t ^treeshrew.$na$` worked as laborers in Malacca. 
`lv ft ^kotti.$na$`
(Chicken) and `lv ft ^tenah.$na$` (Tapir) were mostly farmers in the south or east.
`lv ft ^vanar.$na$` (Monkey) were sparsely spread throughout Lauvìnko territory,
and were usually craftsmen. Certain types of skilled work, such as working of
precious metals and use of wax-resist dyeing techniques, were ritually
reserved for `lv t ^vanar.$na$`. `lv ft ^timi.$na$` (Whale) were a small clan of mostly sailors and
merchants. Trade in some goods such as cumin and tea could only be
conducted by `lv t ^timi.$na$`. `lv ft ^ngeng.$na$` (Rhinoceros) were a small clan of mostly
laborers. `lv ft ^soala.$na$` (Pig) were limited to the north and were mostly scholars
and metalworkers. `lv ft ^selah.$na$` (Snake) were mostly foragers or freshwater
fishermen in inland regions. `lv ft ^mosah.$na$` (Mouse) was a very small clan of a
few farmers in the north. `lv ft ^kolang.$na$` (Turtle) was another very small clan,
but contained a remarkable number of important writers, clerics, and
medicine men throughout the region.

Men were required to marry a bride outside their clan, but typically chose a
woman whose family had the same occupation. For this reason, marriages
were particularly common between certain clans with significant geographic
and socioeconomic overlap, such as between `lv t ^keng.$na$` and 
`lv t ^singa.$na$`, or between `lv t ^treeshrew.$na$` and `lv t ^kotti.$na$`.
