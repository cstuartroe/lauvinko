This section describes all of the Lauvìnko morphology which
derives from Proto-Kasanic. Indeed, since no morphology was lost during the
transition from Proto-Kasanic to Lauvìnko, it also serves as a description
of Proto-Kasanic morphology, merely seen through the phonological lens of
Lauvìnko. Proto-Kasanic was an exclusively prefixing language, and all
of its morphology is essentially verbal: concerning tense, aspect, and mood,
as well as trigger (≈subject) agreement and subordination marking. In both
Proto-Kasanic and Lauvìnko, some of this morphology appears in nouns as well,
albeit in ways that might mostly be characterized as derivational.

Lauvìnko conjunct morphology is largely templatic: there are a discrete
number of slots before the stem, and each slot can be occupied by up to
one affix, except the very first slot ([modals](/modals)), which can
contain several affixes in a compositional order. The slots in order
are *modals, tertiary aspect, trigger agreement, voice, secondary aspect, stem*.
I will discuss the slots in reverse order, beginning with primary tense
and aspect marked via stem-internal ablaut, and ending with the models.
