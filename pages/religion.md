The Lauvìnko historically considered themselves Mahayana Buddhists,
beginning with the conversion of Socyàng. However, Lauvìnko Buddhism was
a mixture of several traditions. Prior to unification, the Lauvìnko practiced an
indigenous animism that featured ancestor worship and a variety of spirits
and deities. When Indian religion arrived, many Hindu deities were mapped
onto the indigenous ones. Sanskrit names began to be used to refer to gods but
the majority of actual worship practices were maintained, such that
apparently Hindu gods were, in Lauvìnko mysticism and storytelling,
behaving rather more like their old Lauvìnko counterparts. Oral folktales and
legends were liable to be modified by the use of a few Sanskrit proper nouns,
rather than actually replaced. At the same time, temples and shrines were
formally modeled on Buddhist stylings, but to many self-proclaimed
Buddhists in the Lauvìnko community, Siddhartha was merely an especially
prominent deity within a pantheon of lesser deities and demons who might
variously be called upon to assist with particular aspects of daily life.
Even after the establishment of the Malaccan Sultanate, many Lauvìnko
remained resistant to Islam. The Lauvìnko community had historically close
ties with the typically Hindu Tamil communities, which may explain both the
persistence of Hindu gods in Lauvìnko religious practice and the continued 
adherence of the Lauvìnko to Indian religion. Nevertheless, some Lauvìnko
converted.

In the 18th century I found that about 20% of Lauvìnko were Muslim and about
80% Hindu-Buddhist. However, religious identity was not a point of
contention - the two groups remained very integrated and amicable, inviting
neighbors of the opposite affiliation over for dinner on their own festival days.
When Diwali occurred during Ramadan, there was a 36-hour period during
which not a single Lauvìnko person was asleep.
