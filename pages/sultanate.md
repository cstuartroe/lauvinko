Malacca was founded around 1400 CE, and shortly thereafter the Lauvìnko
found themselves at the epicenter of a political, economic, and cultural
revolution in Southeast Asia. The rulers of Malacca converted to Islam,
codified their laws, and established economic partnerships with Ming China
and other Islamic nations, and the area transformed relatively suddenly from
a rural region to a center of wealth and exchange. The Arabic and Malay
languages also loomed large, and in this period many loanwords were
absorbed from those sources.

Whereas in the Srivijayan era travel to a major trade center had been difficult,
during the sultanate many Lauvìnko people could make their way between
rural villages and the much nearer Malacca. It became very common for young
men to seek their fortune in trade, and even after marriage they might travel
intermittently or seasonally to the city to conduct business, or relocate their
families into the city. It was a time of burgeoning wealth and status for the
Lauvìnko people as a whole, as they were relatively successful in establishing
themselves in the new, cosmopolitan society. It was also a time of increased
mixture and homogenization among the Lauvìnko as people married well
outside their home villages through connection with the families of business
contacts, helping to erase geographic and cultural divisions within Lauvìnko
society. Though there was plenty of professional and personal integration
with others, especially Malays and Tamils, in urban areas, a taboo on marriage
with non-Lauvìnko ensured that the group remained distinct and
independent.

Notably, the Lauvìnko, like a few other ethnic and expatriate groups in
Malacca, generally did not convert to Islam. This is probably due to the
historic importance of their animistic/polytheistic religion, which was more
difficult to reconcile with the theology of Islam than that of Hindu-Buddhism,
and their close ties to the Tamil community.
