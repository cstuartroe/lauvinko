According to my analysis, Lauvìnko has a quite small consonant inventory 
of only 12 phonemes, though it exhibits a moderate degree of allophony 
in the coronals:

|     |Labial|Dental|Alveolar|Retroflex|Palatal|Velar|Glottal|
|:----|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|:---:|:-----:|
|**Nasal**   |m  |      |n       |(ɳː)     |(ɲ)    |ŋ    |       |	
|**Stop**    |p  |t     |        |(ʈː)     |       |k    |       |	
|**Affricate**|  |      |t͡s    |(ʈ͡ːʂ)   |(t͡ɕ)  |     |       |	
|**Fricative**|  |      |s       |(ʂː)     |(ɕ)    |     |h      |
|**Approximant**|ʋ|     |        |         |j      |     |       |	
|**Lateral** |   |l     |        |         |(ʎ)    |     |	     |
|**Tap**     |   |      |        |(ɽ)      |       |     |       |	

/t l/ are typically dental, while /n t͡s s/ are alveolar. 
Stops are pronounced unaspirated.

[ɽ] is an allophone of /l/ that appears syllable-finally before peripheral 
consonants or word boundaries, and the other retroflex sounds emerge from 
mutual assimilation of /l/ with a following coronal /n t t͡s s/, and only 
appear geminate. Retroflex consonants have apparent minimal pairs with 
alveolar/dental consonants in the middle of words:

```
sister.$na$=$2hon$.$na$ nonce.$na$=$2hon$.$na$

The sister, the nonce word
```

The palatal and alveolo-palatal sounds /ɲ t͡ɕ ʎ ɕ/ appear as allophones 
of coronal consonants /n t͡s l s/ before /i/. They also appear geminate as 
a result of mutual assimilation between any consonant besides /ʋ/ and a 
following /j/. Apparent minimal pairs between (alveolo-)palatals and other 
coronals can thus appear in two ways, both due to merger of /e/ and /i/ in 
unstressed open syllables, and due to assimilation of a consonant with a 
following /j/:


```
nonce.$na$=$2hon$.$na$ nonce.$na$=$2hon$.$na$

The sister, the nonce word
```
