In addition to primary and secondary aspect and tense marking, Lauvìnko
stems can be marked for a third category, aptly named *tertiary* aspect.
Although I call them "aspect" and label them with names traditionally
regarded as aspects, it may be equally accurate to call them relative
tenses.

The two tertiary aspects are:

- Experiential, marked with a prefix *la-* (triggering a fortition mutation)

```
Malacca.$na$ $all$=$exp$-$t1s$-$tage$-go.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$

I've been to Malacca.
```

- Prospective, marked with a prefix *m(p)i-*

```
Malacca.$na$ $all$=$pro$-$t1s$-$tage$-go.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$

I'm going to go to Malacca.
```

Tertiary aspects have two main distinct functions: describing the state
of something, and relative tense.

# Describing state

The first usage of tertiary aspects was seen in the examples above.
The experiential used in that way didn't refer to a particular past
moment when the speaker went to Malacca, simply to their present state
of being someone who has been there; in this sense, it is exactly like
the English perfect with which it is translated. Similarly, the
sentence using the prospective highlighted the speaker's current
intention to go to Malacca.

The experiential is common with a similar distribution to the English
perfect. However, it should be noted that for expressing that
an event will take
place in the future, the prospective aspect is not the only
or even the most common way. It is prototypically used for
events which seem imminent, or actions which a person is planning
or intending to take. Just the plain perfective is often used
with future meaning, potentially with a time adverb if the future
sense is unclear from context.

```
Bright.$gn$.$au$=$3rd$.$sg$.$au$-$gen$ tomorrow top.$na$ $all$=$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-go.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

The sun will rise tomorrow.
```

The adverb `lv;fr later` "later" is bleached
of any sense other than marking future occurrence.

```
Later rice.$na$ $t1s$-$tage$-trade.$np$.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

I will buy rice.
```

---

Tertiary aspect marking is used in nominals, in essentially the same way:

```
marry.$gn$.$na$=$femn$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$, $exp$-marry.$gn$.$na$=$femn$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$, $pro$-marry.$gn$.$na$=$femn$=$hea$.$sg$.$na$

wife, ex-wife, fiancée
```

# Relative tense

When used in narrative alongside other clauses, the experiential aspect
may be used to indicate relative tense.

```
Rice.$na$ $exp$-$t1s$-$tage$-trade.$pt$.$na$=$rck$.$na$ $loc$=sleep.$imnp$.$na$ $all$=$t1s$-$tage$-go.$pf$.$na$=$lea$.$sg$.$na$.

Having bought rice, I went home.
```

Generally, the clause with experiential aspect comes before the other
clause, but it may come after, without much pragmatic difference.

# Primary/secondary tense/aspect marking

For fientive stems, tertiary aspect marking can never be used with
imperfective aspect. The basic sense uses the perfective aspect,
and inceptive or frequentative aspects may be used according to meaning.
With frequentative, only the non-past (front vowel grade) stem
is used.

```
$Gen$=$exp$-$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-see.$pf$.$na$=$rck$.$na$;
$gen$=$pro$-$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-see.$inc$.$na$=$rck$.$na$; 
$gen$=$exp$-$t3as:swrf$-$tage$-see.$fqnp$.$na$=$rck$.$na$.

He has watched it; he will catch sight of it; he has understood it.
```

Similarly, for punctual stems, either perfective or frequentative
may be used with tertiary aspect marking, but always non-past forms.
For stative stems, only the general and inceptive forms
may be used.
